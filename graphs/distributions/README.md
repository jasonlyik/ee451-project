# Graphs With Varying Distributions

Created using RMAT graph generator

TODO: based on the trials with Erdos-Renyi graphs, pick a standard n and nnz and test on differently distributed graphs, test parallel implementation vs itself on different distributions

+ a = 0.25, b = 0.25, c = 0.25, d = 0.25 (Erdos-Renyi)

Granting weight to one quadrant:

+ a = 0.37, b = 0.21, c = 0.21, d = 0.21

+ a = 0.49, b = 0.17, c = 0.17, d = 0.17

+ a = 0.61, b = 0.13, c = 0.13, d = 0.13

Granting weight to two quadrants:

+ a = 0.30, b = 0.30, c = 0.20, d = 0.20

+ a = 0.30, b = 0.20, c = 0.30, d = 0.20

+ a = 0.30, b = 0.20, c = 0.20, d = 0.30

+ a = 0.37, b = 0.37, c = 0.13, d = 0.13

+ a = 0.37, b = 0.13, c = 0.37, d = 0.13

+ a = 0.37, b = 0.13, c = 0.13, d = 0.37
